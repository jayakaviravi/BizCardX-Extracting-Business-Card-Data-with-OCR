### Introduction

BizCardX: Extracting Business Card Data with OCR Overview BizCardX is a Streamlit web application which extracts data from business cards using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Users can upload an image of a business card and the application uses the easyOCR library to extract relevant information from the card. The extracted information is then displayed in a user-friendly format and can be stored in a MySQL database for future reference.

### EasyOCR

EasyOCR is an open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine that makes it easy to extract text from images. OCR is a technology that converts different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDFs, or images captured by a digital camera, into editable and searchable data.
